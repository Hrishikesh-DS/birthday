                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded">Okay, So where do I start. It was probably a week into the first semester.
                         I was a dumb kid who was super excited about engineering and all the possibilities back then :).
                         So obviously I'd stalked the hell out of you since the day I saw you ;).(Tried to follow u in insta and u didnt accept ouchhh)
                          I was like okay Idk how but I have to talk to this girl someone and make her my friend.
                          So, chemistry lab probably a week or 2 into college I mustered up the courage to talk to u in lab.
                          So, u were wearing those baggy af lab uniform and tbh u looked like a bus conductor :))).
                          Later that day I texted u in whatsapp in the most lamest way possible to enquire about lab Stuff
                          and to my pleasant surprise you actually replied to me :3. And hence I guess we kinda became friends XD
                        <br>
                            Then I started getting yum food and ofc since u loved food we started to hang out together...
                            (still think u were friends with me only coz of my food XD). So this is how I remember stuff with us
                            1st hour itself u used to be like DUUUUUDE U GOT FOOOOOD with that cute face of yours and me being this dumb
                            kid you used to instantly melt my heart and I used to give u all my food even if I've nothing left for myself XD.
                        <br>
                            So as days went by I kinda went from the guy u used to receive zone all the time, to the guy you now talk to every single day
                            , who annoys you a lot and will never let u be at peace :). Now that was a interesting turn of events that i never anticipated and hence here we are.

                    <p>
                        I think u obviously know why i kept that title XD. It was the first time u did something huge in toast masters
                        and everybody absolutely loved it. 
                        Soooooo what can I say about you except you are the most amazing person I've ever met and I'm glad to have spent the past 3
                        years with you, and the time i spent with you in class was no doubt the best time I had in engineering  &lt;3.My most fond memories with you are
                        Sneaking around and eating food with you in class XD, Helping you with last moment assignments XD, Getting caught by literally all the 
                        teachers coz we could never keep out mouth shut when we were together XDDD, especially by suryakanth sir. 
                        <br>
                        So lemme say a lil bit about what you mean to me. So the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of u is that youre a meanasssssss
                        . Thanks for making classes bearable for me and when u finally thought u got rid of me lolololol I started to annoy u during quarantine too hahahaha XD.
                        Without me talking to u life would be pretty boring and me a lil miserable :,(. Thanks for always making time for me and being the most wonderful
                        human being I know &lt;3. You've always been by my side from the happy moments where i just wanna eat your brains like imma zombile to the 
                        numerous days where I overthink like a df and you always being by my side to make it all better &lt;3.
                        <br>
                        You are someone I can always rely upto anytime I need you.You always know if something is bothering me and u persistently annoy me till I tell u what it is XD.
                         You have a really amazing way of making most of my problems dissapear in just a small convo.
                        Till date I still dont know what u think about and how your mind works and im always clueless when it comes to u even tho I know so much I know
                        So little about u too coz u dumbass yourself dono what u want :))))
                        <br>
                        Youre a biggg dumbo theres no denying about that okay XD. I really love when u tell me about yourself and tbh nothing would live up to that feeling ngl
                        I guess theres like a million more thing I gotta tell u but lemme cut it short here okayyy
